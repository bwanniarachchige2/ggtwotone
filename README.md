# ggtwotone

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`ggtwotone` is an R package that extends `ggplot2` with dual-stroke and
contrast-aware geoms. It helps you create clear, high-contrast
annotations and lines that remain visible across complex or variable
backgrounds.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

-   geom\_segment\_dual(): Dual-stroke line segments with vertical
    offset

-   geom\_lm\_dual(): Dual-tone regression line with contrast-aware
    strokes

-   geom\_curve\_dual(): Dual-stroke curved line annotations

-   geom\_curve\_dual\_function(): Plot mathematical or statistical
    functions as smooth dual-stroke curves

-   geom\_text\_contrast(): Automatically switches between light/dark
    text color based on background

-   adjust\_contrast\_pair(): Helper function to find contrast-boosted
    color pairs using WCAG/APCA

## Installation

You can install the development version of ggtwotone from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

    # install.packages("pak")
    pak::pak("bwanniarachchige2/ggtwotone")

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

    library(ggplot2)
    library(ggtwotone)

    df <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 1, xend = 1:3, yend = 2)

    ggplot(df) +
      geom_segment_dual(
        aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend),
        color1 = "#FFFFFF", color2 = "#000000", linewidth = 2
      ) +
      theme_dark()

    ggplot() +
      geom_curve_dual_function(
        fun = dnorm,
        xlim = c(-3, 3),
        color1 = "#EEEEEE", color2 = "#222222",
        offset = 0.004,
        linewidth = 1.2,
        smooth = TRUE
      ) +
      theme_dark()

    library(dplyr)

    # 1. Zone-colored background with more Sea tiles
    set.seed(42)
    tile_df <- expand.grid(x = -7:7, y = -7:7)
    zones <- c("Desert", "Forest", "Sea", "Urban")
    zone_colors <- c(
      "Desert" = "#EDC9AF",
      "Forest" = "#14532d",
      "Sea"    = "#0F3556",
      "Urban"  = "#eeeeee"
    )
    tile_df$zone <- sample(
      zones,
      size = nrow(tile_df),
      replace = TRUE,
      prob = c(0.2, 0.2, 0.4, 0.2)  # Increase Sea coverage
    )

    # 2. Realistic wind vectors from various points
    set.seed(42)
    n <- 25
    wind_df <- data.frame(
      x = sample(-4:4, n, replace = TRUE),
      y = sample(-4:4, n, replace = TRUE),
      angle = runif(n, 180, 270),  # Southwest quadrant
      speed = runif(n, 1.5, 4)     # Speed in m/s
    ) |>
      mutate(
        xend = x + speed * cos(angle * pi / 180),
        yend = y + speed * sin(angle * pi / 180)
      )

    # 3. Plot with dual-stroke arrows
    ggplot() +
      geom_tile(data = tile_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = zone)) +
      scale_fill_manual(values = zone_colors, name = "Zone Type") +

      geom_segment_dual(
        data = wind_df,
        aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend),
        color1 = "#FFFFFF", color2 = "#111111",
        linewidth = 1.2,
        arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.15, "inches"), type = "open"),
        alpha = 0.9
      ) +

      coord_fixed(xlim = range(c(wind_df$x, wind_df$xend)),
                ylim = range(c(wind_df$y, wind_df$yend))) +
      theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
      theme(
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = NA)
      ) +
      labs(
        title = "Wind Directions Across Zones",
        subtitle = "Arrow direction and length represent wind flow and speed (m/s);\ndual-stroke improves visibility",
        x = "Longitude",
        y = "Latitude"
      )

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="100%" />

This example visualizes wind directions and speeds over a
zone-classified terrain map using `geom_segment_dual()`.  
Arrow length is scaled by wind speed (in m/s), and dual-stroke styling
ensures clear visibility across contrasting terrain types such as
desert, forest, sea, and urban zones.

# Motivation

In real-world plots, especially on mixed backgrounds (grayscale tiles,
images, or map layers), default ggplot2 annotations can disappear.
ggtwotone solves this with:

-   Dual-stroke visibility: top and bottom layers ensure readability

-   Contrast checking: uses APCA/WCAG to optimize color pairing

-   Fallback safety: gracefully assigns black/white when needed
